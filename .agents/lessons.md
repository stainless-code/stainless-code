# Lessons Convention

## Rules

1. **Read when relevant** — skim when the task matches a bullet below; the file is always attached but read selectively, not a mandatory full read every session.
2. **Append only durable, non-obvious corrections** — not session trivia already in a rule, skill, or reference doc.
3. **Prefer lifting** — when a lesson becomes policy, move it to `.agents/rules/` or the relevant skill and remove the bullet here (or supersede with one line pointing at the rule).
4. **Keep entries atomic** — one lesson per bullet. One sentence.
5. **No duplicates** — merge or supersede instead of appending near-duplicates.
6. **Supersede, don't accumulate** — outdated lesson → one replacement bullet; don't leave both.

<!-- Append durable corrections below, one bullet per line. Keep this file
     short — lift into rules/skills when a lesson becomes policy. -->

- Hub PR auto-deploy + FTP excludes: see [`hub-deploy`](rules/hub-deploy.md) (label `docs` on merge; never `dangerous-clean-slate`).
- Hub `oxfmt` ignores `content/**` so Blume `:::` fences are not collapsed — format/check on content MDX is a no-op by design.
